<!-- <h4>Dundas Heritage Calendar 2006</h4>
<p class="first">August, 2005
</p>

<p>The Dundas Valley Historical Society is pleased to announce the availability of our first-ever Dundas Heritage Calendar. Produced by Northshore Publishing, the calendar features excellent black &amp; white photographs of events and locations from Dundas' past. Numerous historical dates of significance are highlighted throughout. This is a fund-raising project of the Society and a percentage of all sales will accrue to us to support our programming.
</p>

<p>At $15.95 + tax ($18.25 total), you'll want to get a copy for yourself and anyone else on your holiday shopping list who has an interest in local history. The 2006 Dundas Heritage Calendar will be on sale at various locations around town, and can also be purchased at any one of our monthly lecture series presentations.</p> -->
