<h4>Ray Fazakas: The Black Donnellys: The Dundas Connection</h4>
<p class="first">September 8, 2010
</p>

<p>Soon after midnight on February 4, 1880, near Lucan, Ontario, just north of London, five members of the notorious Donnelly family&mdash;James and Johannah, sons John and Tom, and a niece, Bridget&mdash;all met their deaths violently at the hands of a vigilante committee of about 20 men. The massacre and the subsequent trials have become a colourful part of Canadian legend and folklore. This year marked the 130th anniversary of the Donnelly Massacre.</p>

<p>There are major Dundas connections to the Donnelly tragedy, which will be the focus of this presentation.</p>

<p><b>Ray Fazakas</b>, a retired Hamilton lawyer, is the author of <i>The Donnelly Album</i> and <i>In Search of The Donnellys</i>. He has devoted his life to studying the Donnellys and preserving their history. Mr. Fazakas recently donated his entire collection of Donnelly artifacts, the largest collection of  in the world, to the  Lucan Area Heritage & Donnelly Museum in Lucan, Ontario.</p>

</p>

<p>This presentation coincides with the <a href="http://www.dundasmuseum.ca">Dundas Museum</a>'s latest exhibition "Where Theatre Comes to Play: 50 Years of Dundas Little Theatre", a collaborative effort between the Dundas Little Theatre and the Dundas Museum & Archives which will run to January 16, 2011.</p>

<p>From choosing plays to set design to creating costumes to casting to curtain call: for 50 years, the Dundas Little Theatre is indeed where theatre has come to play in our community.

<h4>James Elliott: A Strange Fatality: The Battle of Stoney Creek</h4>
<p class="first">November 10, 2010
</p>

<p>Author James Elliott's presentation is based on his critically-acclaimed book "<a href="http://www.strangefatality.com/">Strange Fatality, The Battle of Stoney Creek, 1813</a>", which will be on sale during this presentation.</p>

<p>Mr. Elliott will discuss the chain of events from almost 200 years ago that culminated in the battle of June 6th, 1813, an intense military struggle that stemmed the tide of invasion, cost two generals their freedom and unseated the highest-ranking soldier in the American army. An assured American victory became one of the most decisive reversals of military fortune of the War of 1812 and greatly determined the fate of Upper Canada. </p>

<p>James Elliott is a local journalist and author who has written extensively on the War of 1812, on subjects ranging from the Bloody Assizes to the Burlington Races&mdash;and most recently on The Battle of Stoney Creek. Mr. Elliott lives with his wife, Irene, in Hamilton, just four miles from the historic Stoney Creek battlefield.

<h4>Susan Spencer: The War of 1812: The Role of Women and Camp Followers
</h4>
<p class="first">January 12, 2011
</p>

<p>Susan Spencer was thrust into sewing at an early age by a mother frustrated by constant "borrowings" of garments from her closet&mdash;which garments usually ended up as portions of costumes. Susan took her first "1st prize" in historical costuming at age seven and never looked back. An eager participant in Edmonton's annual "Klondike Days" 1890s festival from the time she could toddle, it surprised no one when she ended up working at Fort Edmonton in the late 1970s. There she cut her teeth in the business of making history interesting to the public. Her passion for all things historical inspired her to open her business, Spencer's Mercantile, in 1993, a leading supplier of finest quality historical reproduction goods, specializing in items related to the War of 1812.</p>
