<a name="Constitution"><h4>Draft Constitution</h4></a>

<p>After months of weekly working meetings, the Steering Committee released a draft constitution at the general business meeting in May, 2003. Mike Brand gave those attending the meeting an overview of the document and invited comments. Copies of the draft constitution were again distributed at the January, 2004 meeting of the Society and then mailed or e-mailed to everyone on the Society's mailing list who did not pick up their copy at the meeting. The Steering Committee has set a February 18, 2004 deadline for written comments on the draft. It will take all such comments into consideration as it prepares the final draft for approval of the Society at its Inaugural Annual General Meeting on May 19, 2004.
</p>
