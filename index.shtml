<!-- <h3>Looking for Cactus Festival Volunteers</h3>
<p class="first">
The Dundas Valley Historical Society has an important outreach opportunity at
the Dundas Cactus Festival (August 20, 21 and 22). Staffing a booth at
the Festival is one of the most important ways to let people know
about our organization and its activities.</p>

<p>The work is easy and enjoyable&mdash;we welcome you to lend a hand even if
you've never been directly involved with the organizational aspects of
the Society before. We'll be distributing newsletters, the schedule for our upcoming Speaker Series, and we'll have copies of the brand new edition of the Historical Dundas calendar for sale. We will
be sharing space with the Dundas Museum &amp; Archives again this year.</p>

<p>We would like to have two DVHS representatives on hand throughout
the Festival (Friday evening, Saturday and Sunday until 5 pm). We
still have many open slots on the schedule. Please consider signing up
for a two-hour block. Call DVHS president Stan Nowak, 905-627-8832, or 
<script language="JavaScript" type="text/javascript">
var name="president";
var address="DundasHistory.ca";
var link="e-mail him";
spamfoil();
</script> to let him know when you are available.</p>

<p>Hope to see you at the Cactus Festival!</p> -->
