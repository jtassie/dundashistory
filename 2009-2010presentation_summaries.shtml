<h4>Brian Baetz &amp; Margaret Rees: Dundas: A History of Transitions  
</h4>
<p class="first">10 March, 2010
</p>

<p>As Dundas has evolved and grown over the years, it has gone through a number of transitions. One of the most significant of these was the Depression era of the 1930s. This decade was investigated through a review of the Dundas Star archives, in an attempt to discover how Dundas came together to address the challenges of that period. The findings will be shared through a series of story vignettes accompanied by vintage photographs, and conclusions will be discussed on what we can learn from this earlier time as we face the challenges of today.</p>
