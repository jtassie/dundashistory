<h4>Margaret Houghton: Rest In Peace&#8212Cemeteries and Funerals in Hamilton</h4>
<p class="first">21 January, 2004
</p>

<p>Margaret Houghton, Special Collections archivist at the Hamilton Public Library, will tell us the history of several Hamilton cemeteries and give a brief background on some of the interesting people buried in them. Ms. Houghton is the author of several books: <em>Hamilton: Panorama of Our Past</em> and <em>Downtown Hamilton: The Heart Of It All</em>. In her recently published book, <em>The Hamiltonians</em>, Ms. Houghton has assembled fascinating stories from some of the city's most expert writers, including several from Dundas.
</p>

<p>Nothing illustrates the rich variety of Hamilton's history better than the lives of some of those who made the city their home. Many Hamiltonians have learned about their city's past through visits to local cemeteries in the company of a knowledgeable local historian. Among the people we will learn more about are Bessie Starkman, partner of Rocco Perri, King of the Bootleggers, killed in a gangland-style slaying, whose funeral attracted 25,000 spectators in 1930, and Isabella Hyde Whyte, long thought by Hamiltonians to be the illegitimate offspring of Edward, Duke of Kent, Queen Victoria's Father.
</p>

<p>A 1974 Magna Cum Laude graduate in Honours English and History from McMaster University, and 1976 B.Ed. graduate from Hamilton Teachers' College, Ms. Houghton is president of the Head of the Lake Historical Society and the Players Guild of Hamilton, the oldest continuously operating little theatre group in North America, having started in 1875. Margaret Houghton speaks about various aspects of local history to many community groups. Her presentation promises to be a fascinating journey through the lives of many of Hamilton's former citizens.

<h4>Gerard Middleton: The Spencers of Dundas</h4>
<p class="first">21 April, 2004
</p>

<p>A retired Professor of Geology at McMaster University, Gerard Middleton will speak on the celebrated Canadian geologist Joseph Winthrop Spencer. Born and educated in Dundas, Joseph Spencer received his Bachelor of Arts degree in Honours Geology and Mineralogy at Montreal's McGill University in 1874. During his illustrious career, he taught chemistry, geology, and mineralogy at King's College, Nova Scotia, the University of Missouri and Georgia State University. Locally, he is best known for his research in the development of hydroelectric power on the Niagara River. In 1834, Spencer's father, Joseph Spencer, built the Gore Grist Mill in Dundas. It is generally believed that Spencer Creek was named after him. Two of his uncles, James and Benjamin Spencer, were actively engaged in the good works of the Methodist Church&#8212;James as a Methodist circuit rider and Benjamin as the first Sunday School superintendent of the original Methodist church in Dundas, then located on Ogilvie Street, where the Dundas Public Library is presently located.
