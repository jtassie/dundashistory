<h3>Please Join Us

<p>The history of Dundas is filled with inspiring tales of courage, struggle, and achievement. Today, the people of Dundas are continuing to weave the social fabric of this community. To remember our past is to better prepare for our future. Become a member of the Dundas Valley Historical Society and help make history.
</p>

<p>Your membership fee will be used to support Society activities and events, help us communicate with our members and the public, and will allow us to maintain our incorporated status through association with the Ontario Historical Society.
</p>

<p>Membership is open to all individuals who support the goals of the Society. The annual membership fee is $15 for individuals, $20 for families and $250 for an individual lifetime membership. We gratefully accept donations above and beyond the basic membership fees. Our membership year runs from September to August. Becoming a member entitles you to a reduced admission fee for our speaker series presentations and to vote at the Annual General Meeting.
