<h4>Beth Mills: Ancaster Historical Society: Clementina Trenholme Fessenden, The Founder of Empire Day</h4>
<p class="first">October 10, 2012
</p>

<p>
Educated in Montreal schools, Clementina grew up in a home where loyalism and devotion to British traditions were strong. At twenty-one, she married the Reverend Joseph Elisha Fessenden, a Canadian-born Church of England clergyman. The family moved to Fergus, and later to Chippewa on the banks of the Niagara River. There, she honed her writing skills as one of the first editors of the Niagara Women's Auxiliary Leaflet. When Joseph accepted the position of rector at St John's Anglican Church in Ancaster, they relocated there in 1893.</p>

<p>Always trying to find ways to strengthen Canada's links to the British Empire, she identified herself both physically and spiritually with Queen Victoria. She dressed in mourning black like the widowed Queen after her own husband died in 1896. She was responsible for introducing Empire Day in Canadian schools, first in Dundas in 1898 on the last school day before May 24, Queen Victoria's birthday. It was then celebrated more each year and then instituted in England in 1904.</p>

<p>A typical Empire Day in Hamilton schools occupied the entire day and included inspirational speeches by trustees and songs such as <i>The Maple Leaf</i> and <i>Just Before the Battle</i>. A bronze plaque is installed in her memory on the wall of St John's Anglican Church in Ancaster.</p>

<h4>Bob Knuckle, renowned local playwright and Titanic expert: Canada and the Titanic</h4>
<p class="first">November 14, 2012
</p>

<p>This year marked the 100th Anniversary of the sinking of The Titanic, an event that fascinates us to this day! Local playwright and Titanic aficionado Robert Knuckle is an Actra award-winning author of nine books and two booklets. Most of them are about true crime and/or tales of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. He has written for the stage, television, radio, and cinema. Seven of his stage plays have been produced at major venues in Canada and Europe including the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. He is also a contributing researcher with Encyclopedia Titanica.</p>

<h4>Shannon Kyles, Professor of Architecture, Mohawk College: Local Architectural History and Heritage: "One Citizen’s Revolt against Mediocrity" or "Taking Buildings into Your Own Hands ... Literally"
</h4>
<p class="first">January 9, 2013
</p>

<p>Shannon Kyles is a local architectural historian, author and editor of the Historic Architecture in Arabella Magazine, Architecture Contributer for CBC's Fresh Air with Mary Ito, and instructor at Mohawk College. In 2010, Miss Kyles proved that she is also clearly insane. Finding an historic property on the way to the land fills, she took it into her own hands to take the house apart, move it to a neighbourhood that would suit it and reconstruct it. The house is almost back together and maybe she is not as crazy as she looks.

<h4>Rick Hatt, great-great-great grandson of Richard Hatt: The War of 1812 and the Hatt Brothers (Richard and Samuel) 
</h4>
<p class="first">March 13, 2013
</p>

<p>Rick Hatt, in his own words:</p>

<p>I was born on a baby beef farm in Lion's Head, Ontario (Bruce Peninsula) in 1947. After graduation from grade 13 in Wiarton, Ontario, I decided that I had shovelled enough STUFF and was hired as a Lineman for Bell Canada in Toronto in 1968.  I retired in 1997 after close to 30 years in the communications business (including a 3 year stint in Saudi Arabia as a consultant). After retirement, I stayed home for 2 years&mdash;became a councillor for the Town of Pelham (2 terms)&mdash;aced the cleaning and cooking business at home while my wife was still working. I operated a communications consultant business in Mississauga until 2009. Currently, I work locally 1 to 2 days a week in Fonthill&mdash;no more driving. I am married to Cathy with 2 grown children in the area and 2 wonderful grandchildren. I do continue to work on protecting my family’s grave site in Ancaster , all the while hoping that the developer will abide by the 2010 OMB ruling that finally protected the 100 graves that are interred at this site.</p>

<h4>Dr. Raymond Hobbs, Author and Lecturer on Warfare&mdash;ancient and 1812: The War of 1812: George Ferguson's War
</h4>
<p class="first">April 10, 2013
</p>

<p>The Rev. George Ferguson was a tireless Methodist circuit rider in Upper Canada (Canada West) from 1818 until his death at the age of sixty one in 1854. His activities covering an area from Kingston to Amherstburg are well-remembered in the annals of early Methodism in Canada.
Born in Ardtrea, Londonderry, Ireland, he came to Canada in 1813, but not as a simple immigrant. He was a soldier in the 100th (The Prince of Wales County of Dublin) Regiment of Foot. He was a member of the Light Company (first on the field, last to retire), and fought in six battles during the war.
But he was a pacifist.
The Journal he wrote in the closing decade of his life offers a unique glimpse at a soldier’s life during the war, but also of the struggles with his conscience as a follower of the Prince of Peace.
</p>

<p>Born in Wales, and after graduate study at the University of London (PhD) and the University of Zürich, Ray Hobbs taught at McMaster University in the Faculty of Theology for twenty seven years, and thereafter in Prague for three. While at McMaster he travelled frequently to the Mediterranean and Middle East with students on historical study tours. For six seasons he directed The Canadian Tel Dor Project, which excavated at Tel Dor in Israel. His primary focus was on the weaponry unearthed at the site. He is a member of several learned societies in North America and Britain. He currently serves as President of Dundas Valley Historical Society. 
In another life he is a member of the Regimental Council of the Royal Highland Fusiliers of Canada, one of Canada’s leading Reserve Regiments, and serves on the Regiment’s bursary committee. Active in the Living History community, he is also the Honorary Colonel of the 41st Regiment of Foot.</p>

<p>Dr. Hobbs is the author of one book on ancient warfare, and is working on another. He has written dozens of articles in scholarly journals and collected essays on the same topic. He is particularly interested in the relationship of warfare and religion. Having retired from full-time teaching, he now devotes his time to his research, writing and frequently lecturing on ancient warfare and the War of 1812. He is also putting the finishing touches to three manuscripts on the War of 1812 for publication.  He is a member of the organizing committee of the highly successful series of 1812 Symposia. Those with sharp eyes may capture him as the disgraced American General Wilkinson in the recently produced PBS documentary on the War of 1812.</p>

<p>He lives in Hamilton with his wife, Heather, and they have two children. He thoroughly enjoys life as the grandfather of four granddaughters who live in Toronto and Chelsea, Quebec.</p>
