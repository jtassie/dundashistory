<h4>Mary Anderson: Tragedy &amp; Triumph: Ruby &amp; Thomas B. McQuesten</h4>
<p class="first">October 12, 2011
</p>

<p>Dr. Mary J. Anderson holds a PhD from McMaster in English and is a published writer and playwright. Her second book, which launched on April 9, 2011 at the Hamilton Public Library is: Tragedy &amp; Triumph: Ruby &amp; Thomas B. McQuesten. Mary directs the web site: <a href="http://www.whitehern.ca/">www.whitehern.ca</a> which contains nearly 4000 letters, photos and documents from Whitehern Museum, all dealing with three generations of the McQuesten Family. For the web site, she has partnered with the Hamilton Public Library, McMaster University, and Whitehern Museum. Mary is a regular speaker for various heritage groups and is a member of the Hamilton Historical Board. 
</p>
<p>The Hamilton Historical Board has named 2011 as “McQuesten Year”, so her presentation will be based on her book, Tragedy &amp; Triumph: Ruby &amp; Thomas B. McQuesten. 
</p>

<h5>General Bio of the McQuesten Family of Whitehern
</h5>
<p>The McQuesten family of Hamilton, from 1835 to 1968, represents three generations of advancement, in Hamilton and throughout Ontario in industry, education, politics, commerce, roads, bridges, culture, museums, parks, tourism, art and beautification. </p>

<p>Dr. Calvin McQuesten (1801&ndash;1885) opened Hamilton’s first foundry in 1835 at James and Merrick Streets, and from that humble beginning Hamilton became known as “The Birmingham of Canada.” The McQuesten story is a saga in three generations, Dr. Calvin earned the fortune; his son Isaac lost the fortune to bankruptcy and died suddenly at the age of 40, leaving a wife impoverished with six children between the ages of 14 and 2. Hon. Thomas Baker McQuesten restored the family. 
</p>
<p>Ruby Baker McQuesten (1879&ndash;1911) became a teacher to provide the funds for Tom’s education so that Tom could graduate in law and enter politics. She was a fine artist and was Tom’s mentor, but just as he graduated, she fell ill and died of tuberculosis at the age of 31. Then she was forgotten. She is the Tragic Victorian Heroine of the story. We are planning a showing of her paintings and pyrography between August 27 and November 13, 2011 at the Hamilton Art Gallery.

<h4>Craig Williams: War of 1812: James Fitzgibbon, 49th Regiment of Foot
</h4>
<p class="first">January 11, 2012
</p>

<p>This presentation is the first of the year, the bicentennial of the War of 1812!</p>

<p>Craig Williams is an artist, historian and re-enactor who has often served as a historical consultant for the movie and television industry.  He is a founding member of the Canadian Military History Society and, as a member of such, was involved with the first War of 1812 re-enactments at Old Fort Erie and the recreation of the 49th Regiment of Foot. Through his work at Fort York, Craig was instrumental in the organizing of the very first battle re-enactment at Stoney Creek in 1979.</p>

<p>Craig will discuss the 49th Regiment's involvement during the War of 1812 and, in particular, the famed Lieutenant James FitzGibbon, who served in the Regiment under Isaac Brock. During the War, Lt.  FitzGibbon formed a hand-picked corps to deal with American raiders along the Niagara River. They were nicknamed the 'Green Tigers' or the 'Bloody Boys' due to their exceptional courage, fierceness in fighting and the colour of their uniforms.  James FitzGibbon, himself a brilliant tactician and immensely popular leader, became a hero in Upper Canada, where he lived for many years after the conclusion of the War of 1812.  </p>
