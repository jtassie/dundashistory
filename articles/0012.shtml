<h3>Darkness Befalls Dundas at Noon</h3>

	<em>The unrepentant heat wave offered perfect conditions for the fire to spread throughout the thirsty fields of the northern Alberta plains. The air blackened as the smoke churned upwards into the sky, while the inferno dominated the horizon and swelled, igniting the arid grasses in its path. The flames were everywhere! It was only just beginning.</em></p>

<p>	The day began as a typical autumn Sunday in the Valley Town. Family calendars were filled with the customary Sunday services and the usual family meals and gatherings. But by late morning, the promising sunny day started to change as unfamiliar dark clouds of red and copper rolled in from the west. Further to the west, an approaching solid black cloud seemed to forecast a storm of epic magnitude.</p>

<p>By noon, the town was blanketed by a “spectacular yellow haze” that just grew darker as the day went on. Lawns took on a softer hue of green as the smoke filtered the sunlight blocking out blues and violets. Dogs howled, horses and cows were agitated. Even the birds were a little bewildered as they all ceased their singing and chirping and were seen nervously huddled in their nests or in eavestroughs. By mid-afternoon, as the unearthly darkness continued to descend, cars needed to turn on their headlights to drive through town. The streets were deserted except for youngsters perhaps hurrying home a little faster than usual from their Sunday School classes.</p>

<p>Above the town, the sky was aglow with various shades of yellow, grey, and pink. At times, it seemed like the sun was shining from true north. Periodically, the solar disc itself would appear through the filtering smog, but with no apparent glare. The Desjardins Canal turning basin offered a fantastic reflection of the bruised clouds and dramatic visions overhead.</p>

<p><em>As the prairie fires intensified, with the black smoke providing an eerie backdrop to the brilliantly-coloured flames, prevailing winds from the west began to shift the expanding cloud eastward. Soon, half the continent&#8212;including the Town of Dundas, Ontario&#8212;was blanketed in abnormal darkness. </em></p>

<p>The sky was still overcast late in the afternoon when the lights went out, and  Dundas was plunged further into darkness. This electrical power failure happened as the result of an energy transfer from the John Street to the King Street electrical station as part of a routine maintenance procedure. A planned shut-down had occurred earlier that day, but full power was restored by 9:30 A.M. This second power outage was to be a brief one. But the smoggy situation taxed both stations as residential electrical demands increased for their lights and furnaces (the temperature plummeted by 8 degrees F). Thus, by 5:30 P.M., when the energy transfer had been completed to the King Street station, it was too much for the station to handle, and an extended power failure occurred. </p>
	
<p>Dundas residences were ablaze in candlelight as Sunday dinners were eaten in true pioneer style that night. Sunday night church services that evening were larger than normal. The people of Dundas must have felt that the biblical apocalypse was nigh as that Sunday, the 24th of September 1950 came to a somewhat uncertain conclusion.</p>

<p><em>Monday morning of the 25th saw the end of the drought as overnight rains fell on Alberta, which helped quell the 36 separate fires, including a fifty-square-mile blaze some 340 miles north of Edmonton. The outside temperature fell to comfortable levels and the crisis was over.</em></p> 

<p>That Monday morning also saw Dundas, Ontario restored with full electrical power as a typical work week commenced. Though traces of the smog were still evident, they were expected to dissipate in time for the total lunar eclipse expected that night. Otherwise, the day was seasonably warm, and the sky overhead was sunny and blue.
