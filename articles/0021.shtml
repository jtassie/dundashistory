<h3>Big Man with a Big Heart Played Large Part in Dundas History</h3>
<p class="first"><em>by Stan Nowak</em> <br />This article was first published in the July 9, 2003 edition of the Dundas Star News. Reproduced with permission of the author.</p>

<p>Working with the recently resurrected Dundas Valley historical society this past year has been an educational, as well as a socially, rewarding experience. I have learned so much of Dundas' history and made some new friends along the way. I have also learned of people from our history who are no longer with us, but because if their commitment and dedication, we in Dundas benefit today. </p>

<p>Some of these characters led more colourful lives than others, but all were vital in shaping the Dundas we live in today. Some of these past lives endured heart-wrenching tragedies, burt rebounded stronger than ever.</p>

<p>One such individual to grace our local history books is James Coleman. Born in Ireland in 1810, he arrived in Dundas in 1832 seeking his fortune. He started with a small general store on Main Street, and he worked until he eventually became the most successful merchant in Dundas, importing and exporting large varieties and quantities of goods. He owned ships, factories and mills, and was also Mayor of Dundas from 1850&#8211;52.</p>

<p>But along with his fortunes, he experienced more than his share of bad luck. When wheat prices collapsed following the end of the Crimean War, Mr. Coleman experienced a substantial financial setback. </p>

<p>But his blackest day was June 12, 1865, when five young people drowned in the Desjardins Canal. Two of those people were his daughter, Caroline, and his son, Edwin, his heir apparent. The conclusion of the American Civil War that same year brought about another economic depression which resulted in another financial setback </p>

<p>The fourth major disaster in his life was the burning down of his beautiful home&#8212;at that time the largest in Dundas&#8212;in 1869. Mr. Coleman rebuilt it at once, but as the depression continued, he was driven into bankruptcy and lost his home in 1872. </p>

<p>Today, the site is occupied by the St. Joseph's Estates on the corner of Ogilvie Street and Governors' Road. James Coleman moved to Hamilton, and rebounded yet again by organizing the Hamilton Iron Forging Works, which he managed until his death on March 6, 1881.</p>

<p>His funeral was a lavish affair befitting a man who lived his life large. Mourners were transported from Hamilton to Grove Cemetery in sleighs where he was buried alongside his wife and six children who predeceased him.</p>

<p>James Coleman was a big man with a big heart and did everything in a big way. His unbowing spirit allowed him to overcome tragedies that would have overcome a lesser individual, but also allowed him to achieve phenomenal successes that enriched his life as well as the lives of those around him and left a memorable imprint in Dundas history.</p>
