<h4>David Richard Beasley: From Bloody Beginnings: Richard Beasley's Upper Canada</h4>
<p class="first">08 October 2008
</p>
<p><b>Synopsis of the Book on which this Presentation will be Based</b>
<br />Richard Beasley narrates from when he is five years old in 1766 as witness to the tenant rebellions in New York State followed by the American Revolution when his father Henry Beasley and Uncle Richard Cartwright in Albany, New York, risk their lives through the horrors of the civil war for the loyalist forces. Richard Beasley becomes a commissary at Fort Niagara, from which he observes the war out of Niagara featuring his cousin Richard Cartwright Jr, secretary to Major John Butler of Butler’s Rangers, Chief Joseph Brant and Ensign Walter Butler while he continues his fur-trading at Toronto and the Head-of-the-Lake Ontario. After the war, his land dealings, merchant business and association in trade with Richard Cartwright Jr and Robert Hamilton, his arguments on the settlers’ behalf in the legislature where he was speaker of the Assembly, and his involvement as agent in the German land companies in Markham and Waterloo Counties, particularly during the Aaron Burr conspiracy with the French to retake Canada, make him suspect to the oligarchy in York, later Toronto. As magistrate and organizer of the militia in West York he takes on several roles during the War of 1812. The battles in the Niagara Peninsula, which involve the 2nd York Regiment of which he is Colonel, he describes in detail.</p> 

<p>As his intellectual cousin Richard Cartwright becomes more conservative and prominent, Richard Beasley grows more liberal. His correspondence with the famous defender of civil liberties Lord Erskine, his work for a free press, his championing of the reforms of Robert Gourlay and his friendship as a moderate reformer with William Lyon Mackenzie continue the political themes introduced earlier in the book. He manages to overturn the judgment of a military tribunal set up to ruin him by his powerful enemies, including Reverend Strachan and Col. William Claus, for his political views. He relates the economic blights, the pastimes, the joys and sorrows of the settlers with particular emphasis on affairs at the Head- of-the-Lake, which, with his help, becomes Hamilton, a county capital. He gives us interesting details of the Upper Canada Rebellion and shows that many among the Upper Canadian community sympathized with it. In his last stint in the Assembly he does much for the establishment of civil rights and works with his one-time conservative opponent John Beverley Robinson for the country’s benefit before the uniting of the provinces in the Act of Union of 1841. Richard Beasley gives us a personal, continuous and dramatic picture of our history and the characters that made it. Richard died in 1842.</p>

<p>The book is available for $20 from Davus Publishing, <a href="http://www.kwic.com/davus/">www.kwic.com/davus</a>.</p>

<h4>Ray Hobbs, DVHS Board member, War of 1812 historian: The War of 1812: What on Earth has it got to do with Dundas?
</h4>
<p class="first">14 January, 2009
</p>

<p>Mr. Hobbs will discuss the effect that the war had on the village of Coote’s Paradise/Dundas. The village seemed to escape much of the turmoil created by the war at the Head of the Lake (Barton, Saltfleet, Ancaster, Nelson), until the Fall of 1813. Then the war appeared on the doorstep of Dundas with a vengeance! The presentation will trace these events and look at some of the results of the conflict and their effects on the Dundas Valley region.</p>

In 1969, he emigrated to Canada to take up a position at McMaster, where he stayed until 1995. He then taught for three years in Prague, and retired from full-time teaching in 1998. He continues to lecture at McMaster on occasion and writes articles, mainly in the field of ancient military history. He has a passion for the War of 1812, and has written and lectured on the topic over the past ten years.</p>

<h4>Theresa McCarthy, Indigenous Studies, McMaster University: The Dish with One Spoon: Local Aboriginal History
</h4>
<p class="first">11 February, 2009
</p>

<p><i>The Dish With One Spoon</i> is a recent film produced by McMaster University's Department of Indigenous Studies about the Haudenosaunne reclaiming traditional lands to protect the environment from encroachment, development and destruction. Highlighting the Elders’ understanding of historical trauma and directions to 'begin to heal our nations', this documentary works towards raising consciousness of Indigenous Peoples’ struggle. Youth voices and traditional leaders chronicle their perspectives, with all speaking to healing collectively from historical trauma using Indigenous knowledge and traditional practices. The film is approximately 75 minutes long, and there will be a brief Q&A afterwards.</p>
 
<p><b>Teresa McCarthy</b>, a co-director of this film,  is a full-time lecturer with the Department of Indigenous Studies at McMaster University, where she will be graduating with her PhD from the Department of Anthropology. Theresa (Onondaga Nation, Beaver clan) is the daughter of Six Nations community members Honey and Michael McCarthy from Caledonia.</p>
